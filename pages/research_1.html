                        <p>We kicked off our research by grounding ourselves in a guiding purpose by centering the needs of students, not predefined solutions. From the beginning, we focused on what kind of future we wanted to enable for students, and how schools could better support that future.</p>
                        
                        <p>This guiding vision shaped our research approach, helping us decide who to talk to, what questions to ask, and what signals to follow as we look deeper into public education as the problem space.</p>
