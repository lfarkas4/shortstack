            <div class="problem-description">
              In today's academic environment, high school students are constantly making decisions about what classes to take, what clubs to join, and how to prepare for life after graduation. Even motivated students often struggle to connect their choices to a larger sense of purpose. They are surrounded by opportunities, but don’t always see how those fit together or where they might lead. Many stick with what feels familiar, not because they aren’t curious but because there isn’t a clear path forward.

              Students hesitate to take risks because they don’t see the value and the system around them doesn’t show it either. Exploration and curiosity can feel confusing or risky. Without the right support or tools, it’s easier to follow the expected path than to imagine new ones.<br /><br />
              Stack shifts that dynamic. By making students’ progress visible, their options clear, and their decisions feel supported. It helps them explore with purpose instead of pressure. This isn’t just about planning for the future, it’s about giving students more agency in the present.
